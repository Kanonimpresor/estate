# estate
A plugin for the e107 Content management System to manage Real Estate Agencies, Agents, and Listings

The _Estate_ plugin is not ready yet. I have a lot to do before it can be published.

This plugin started as a way for an individual Real Estate agent to easily list their properties for sale and has evolved into one that can handle multiple agents and agencies. 

#FEATURES

#Built In Quick Add User form to create a new User and Agent profile from within the Estate plugin.
#Custom Agent Profiles keyed to User Profiles.
#Muti-table Database to store common information shared between property listings
#In-form editable Dropdown menus and other shared data options.
